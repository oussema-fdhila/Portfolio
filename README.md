## Projects
###  Risk Management

Reduced risks by conducting extensive research on relevant literature, extracting valuable data from multiple sources, and performing thorough summaries and preprocessing tasks, including working with two key books. Leveraged this knowledge to develop chatbots, leading to the attainment of several certifications, such as the Natural Language Processing (**NLP**) Specialization and Graph Neural Networks (**GNN**), through the implementation of this project.


### Curriculum Based Platform

Developed a cross-platform solution integrating **Machine Learning**, **Deep Learning**, and Natural Language Processing (**NLP**) to create an interactive learning experience for students and educators. This platform leverages advanced technologies, including **Python**, **MongoDB**, and **web scraping**, to deliver a robust and engaging educational tool.

### Diagnosis of Chronic Kidney Disease

Using documents (such as medical records, reports, or clinical notes) to detect whether a person is ill. This typically involves applying Natural Language Processing (**NLP**) techniques to extract meaningful information from the text and then utilizing **machine learning** models to classify or predict the presence of a disease based on the extracted data.
